# learn-go-with-tests

This repository serves as a way to document my journey on diving deep in Go. I will be learning Go along with Test Driven Development approach using this wonderful [course](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests) by quii. This takes a lot of reading but that's actually good for me, so I could get comfortable reading long ass documentations.

In this repository, I will be doing guided tasks based on the course, while wrapping my head around it and building mental models needed. I will also be documenting my learnings and realizations. I'm excited on this journey as this will be my secondary language along with TypeScript.

## Motivation

I love Golang ever since I wrote and refactored an existing codebase during my internship. It's so simple and ✨elegant✨ to write. I just want to be good at things I do and I want to be better than I was yesterday because I feel like I'm already hitting my comfort zone again, and I need to step away from it.
